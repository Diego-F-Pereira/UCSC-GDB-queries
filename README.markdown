#Install Ruby, MySQL and Rails
I found the following links very useful to accomplish this task<br />
On [Ubuntu 11.04](http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/ubuntu-ruby-rvm-rails-and-you/)<br />
On [Windows 7 x64](http://allaboutruby.wordpress.com/2009/07/20/installing-rails-on-windows-3-years-later/)<br />
On [Cygwin for Windows 7 x64](http://robborex.wordpress.com/2011/05/03/159/)<br />
Cygwin and MySQL are not very close friends. <br />
Therefore I recomend to use the Ruby Installer when working on Windows. <br />
If you have problems using mysql library take a look at this nice [post](http://blog.mmediasys.com/2011/07/07/installing-mysql-on-windows-7-x64-and-using-ruby-with-it/)<br />
